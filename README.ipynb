    "\n",
    "After running this example, you may want to scale up to testing multiple molecules or ligands. \n",
    "\n",
    "### What to Consider\n",
    "\n",
    "- Decide how many docking runs you want to try per job. If one molecule can be tested in a few seconds, you can probably run a few hundred in a job that runs in about an hour. \n",
    "- How should you divide up the input data in this case? Do you need individual input files for each molecule, or can you use one to share? Should the molecule files all get copied to every job or just the jobs where they're needed? You can separate groups of files by putting them in separate directories or tar.gz files to help with this. \n",
    "- Look at [this guide](https://portal.osg-htc.org/documentation/htc_workloads/submitting_workloads/submit-multiple-jobs/) to see different ways that you can use HTCondor to submit multiple jobs at once. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to use a different (or additional) docking programs, you can include them in the same job by downloading and including those software files in your job submission. \n",

    "\n",
    "Included in this directory is *one* approach to analyzing multiple ligands, by \n",
    "submitting multiple jobs. For the given files we are assuming that there are multiple \n",
    "directories with input files we want to run (`run01`, `run02`, `run03`, etc.) and each \n",
    "job will process all of the ligands in one of these \"run\" folders. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the script, `vina_multi.sh`, we had added a for loop in order to process all \n",
    "the ligands that were included with the job: \n",
    "\n",
    "\t# Run vina on multiple ligands        \n",
    "\tfor LIGAND in *ligand.pdbqt\n",
    "\tdo \n",

    "\tdone\n",
    "\n",
    "This assumes that all of the ligands have a naming scheme that we can \n",
    "match using a wildcard (the `*` symbol). \n",
    "\n",
    "And in the submit file, we have replaced the single input directory `data` with \n",
    "a variable `inputdir`, representing one of the `run` directories.  The value \n",
    "of that variable is set via the queue statement \n",
    "at the end of the submit file: \n",
